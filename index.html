      How was your first week at Boca Code? I know it was really rough and you feel like you don't belong. You will
      continue to learn many new skills. It will seem a bit much; however, you will get this eventually. Right now,
      everything still isn't coming together. <p>You are and will continue to go through this Imposter Syndrome every
        week. The feelings of failing behind compared to the whole class. Your small wins are going to look like the
        size of an ant. </p> Just know that they are still wins nonetheless. Right now you feel determine to get to that "I got it!"
      moment. Just understand that it's okay that you may never get to it until you graduate or the latter. Please take
      into consideration that you are putting in the work and giving it your all everyday. That doesn't mean you're a
      failure. It's just you need to practice more outside of the 10 weeks given.
